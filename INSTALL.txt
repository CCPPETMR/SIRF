Cygwin installation steps (Python interface only)
=================================================

Install Boost, SWIG and cmake using cygwin setup.

Download STIR to a cygwin folder, and in this folder run cmake:

cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-O3 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where STIR libraries re to be built> ./

Run make to build STIR.

Run make install to install STIR libraries.

Download xSTIR to a cygwin folder.

Add four user variables to Windows environment variables (or export them in cygwin):

Variable         Value

STIR_CYGWIN     Path to src sub-folder of STIR folder
STIRLIB_CYGWIN  Path to STIR libraries folder (cf. cmake command above)
CSTIR_CYGWIN	Path to cSTIR sub-folder of xSTIR folder
PYTHON_CYGWIN   Cygwin python (currently cygwin has python2.7, but that may change)

Go to pSTIR sub-folder and run make.
